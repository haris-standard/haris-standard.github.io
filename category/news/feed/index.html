										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United Nations Board of Significant Inspiration (UNBOSI) has been researching sites of human genius since the 1950s. Unfortunately, our research has shown inspiration to be lacking in the places we need it the most. The inspiration could be hiding anywhere, in your houses, gardens or broader community. Help us to imbue marbles with inspiration that can be sent to world leaders who seem to have lost theirs. We are holding new online Marble Run Workshops; if you have been exposed to high levels of inspiration recently, we want to harness your power through the marble run to the marbles themselves.</p>
<p>Our highly trained Marbleologists will take you through creating a ‘MEEM’ (Marble Experience Exposure Machines) or Marble Runs. During these workshops, we hope to imbue more marbles with inspiration, leading to a large increase in moments of human genius.</p>
<p>If you are interested in signing up, you can do so here:</p>
<p><strong>These are the Workshop Dates and times:</strong></p>
<p>May 8th 10am<br />
May 22nd 10am<br />
June 5th 10am<br />
June 5th 11.30am<br />
June 19th 10am<br />
June 19th 11.30am<br />
June 26th 10am<br />
June 26th 11.30 am</p>
<h1>REGISTER NOW</h1>
<p>[event-list column=3 show=6]</p>
<p>If you are looking for some important activities to take part in with your family or friends (in a COVID-19 secure way), we would appreciate the help you can give us. The essential things you need to know are:<br />
These workshops are free and last for approximately one hour<br />
If you have several people in the same household or bubble who want to join in, they can use the same device. You do not need to use a device per person. But please state how many people as there is a limit of 24 participants per call.</p>
<p>Please feel free to use any materials you can find at home to create your marble run, dry recycling or toys you already own that will work exceptionally well for this experiment.</p>
<p>You don’t need to use marbles; specifically, any spherical object will do.</p>

Members of the public are being invited to reveal their <strong>‘lightbulb moments’</strong> where they felt significantly inspired. In addition to revealing their inspirational thoughts, they are being asked to record their location and the activity they were engaged in at the moment of inspiration. This project comes about as a result of research which shows that levels of inspiration have been proven to be stronger at certain geographical locations where a release of a harmless, odourless, invisible substance which emanates from fissures on the surface of the earth. This substance UNBOSI scientists have named <strong>MUSE (Micro-molecular Unseen Sensory Emanations).</strong>
<h2>Take Part!</h2>

<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Mission</strong></em></h2>
<p>UNBOSI is one of the lesser-known departments of the United Nations. Since 1947 we have been globally studying sites associated with human genius. UNBOSI was created with the knowledge that even after a war to end all wars, world leaders had failed to keep the peace and tend to be conservative uninspired negative thinkers. With most of the world on board, we have joined forces and use the power of the planet to create ‘light bulb’ moments inspiring co-operation and friendship between all nations.</p>
<hr>
<h2><em><strong>History</strong></em></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United Nations Board of Significant Inspiration was created by the United Nations General Assembly on the 22nd of October 1947, to pursue the development and dispersal of condensed inspiration.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The secrecy of the department has made it challenging to isolate information regarding its founders and activities. However, there is evidence that its creation was in response to the devastation left by World War II and global dangers posed by the beginnings of the Cold War. Allegedly the founders were a diverse group of salient thinkers of the time. Only world leaders and select individuals have been aware of its existence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The original mandate of UNBOSI was to disperse inspiration surreptitiously amongst world leaders and influential people; with the aim of eliminating enmity and finding real resolutions to complex geopolitical and humanitarian issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2016, due to the actions of some member nations, the department has become public. The mandate was further extended to address long-term global inspiration levels. With a new priority to distribute inspiration to every individual in the world the creation of an inspired global network. Consequently, this has permitted an expansion of the department&#8217;s research and engagement with communities and government bodies. The current acting director of the department is Roger Hartley.</span></p>
<hr>
<h2 align="justify"><strong><em>Research</em></strong></h2>
<p align="justify">The Board of Significant Inspiration is predominantly involved with research about inspiration which has diversified in its scope over the years. During its infancy, the department focused their energy on investigating prominent historical figures of genius. This was a vast undertaking, covering over four-thousand years of history and delving into rigorous details about the lives of significant individuals. In the hopes of discovering a correlation between them and pinpointing their source of inspiration. A small example of the individuals investigated are pictured below.</p>
<p>
<a href='/lamarr-hedy/'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/lamarr-hedy-e1655201720652-300x300.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/lamarr-hedy-e1655201720652-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/lamarr-hedy-e1655201720652-400x400.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/lamarr-hedy-e1655201720652-100x100.jpg 100w, /wp-content/uploads/lamarr-hedy-e1655201720652-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/lamarr-hedy-e1655201720652.jpg 499w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
<a href='/180px-%e6%b9%af%e9%a1%af%e7%a5%96-2/'><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/180px-湯顯祖-1.jpg" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/180px-湯顯祖-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/180px-湯顯祖-1-100x100.jpg 100w, /wp-content/uploads/180px-湯顯祖-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>
</p>
<p align="justify">The first notable discovery was the subtle prevalence of marbles both throughout history and the lives of the significant individuals. A theory proposed by one of the department leading thinkers, whose identity must remain anonymous, was that marbles had a capacity to store and concentrate inspiration into a purer form. Through certain rituals or&nbsp;processes conducted by these individuals, they imbued marbles with an enhanced concentration of their own natural inspiration. The marble would slowly emanate back this reverberated inspiration and induce states of sudden genius.</p>
<p align="justify">Following up this theory led to the recent discovery of a cache of lost ancient marbles (the existence of which was purely myth until now) in the&nbsp;city of Mohenjo-daro,&nbsp; Pakistan. Ancient relics found with the marbles have strongly supported the theory of marbles and indicated they played a far greater role in our history than originally thought.</p>
<p align="justify">With the stride in technological advancement, these marbles were closely analysed and exposed to a variety of top-secret experiments conducted across the globe. Which culminated in the most revolutionary discovery of a new substance which was named MUSE &#8211; Micro-molecular Unseen Sensory Emanations.</p>
<hr>
<h2 align="justify"><strong><em>Help!</em></strong></h2>
<p align="justify">After discovering the concentration of MUSE at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford Upon Avon, we are undertaking a global enquiry to determine if there is a noted correlation between time, geography and action in generating &#8216;light bulb&#8217; moments of genius in Humans. Which should help us understand better the complex entanglement of MUSE and perhaps reveal the location of more concentrated MUSE reservoirs.</p>

We&#8217;ve discovered high levels of inspiration in your region and are looking to work with partners from a range of disciplines across communities in <strong>Fenland and Forest Heath</strong>. We&#8217;d love for you to be involved in this process and project! We need to make a range of experiences for marbles that will then be shared with the public, spreading inspiration across the region in the hope of making the creative geniuses of tomorrow.</p>
<h6><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can you contribute?</span></h6>
<p>We’ve been working with the Market Place consortium to identify and connect with local partners and people. We’re looking for active participants in a range of roles:</p>
<p>Amateurs- looking to gain new skills, new experiences, designing, making, advocating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Professionals- wanting to share your skills and make something outside of your normal work?</p>
<p>2. Engineers, artists, performers, teachers, organisations &#8211; Want to be a part of the UNBOSI legacy and support our work through sharing resources, expertise, capacity?</p>
<p>3. Advocates &#8211; People who want to be vocal supporters of our happenings and work with us to engage and empower communities across the region and or your personal locality, through connecting us with others, supporting the development of our activity, being with us at key events in the programme.</p>
<p>4 Field officers &#8211; become an active member of the Board, we’re always on the lookout for new field officers who’ll support our work in the locality but also be part of the future, leaving a legacy and a presence in the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h6><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will it mean to be part of UNBOSI?</span></h6>
<p>You can make something happen/be a part of something, we&#8217;re only just beginning to be more public facing which means the Fenland / Forest Heath is among our first public happenings!</p>
<p>You’ll be directly credited as a partner/supporter of our work, you’ll be responsible for creating the light-bulb moments and the creative genius of tomorrow (we’ve certainly noticed a lack in our current political/global structures, have you?).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll be putting Forest Heath / Fenland on the map as a place of significant inspiration and unleashing inspiration upon the region, making it a hotbed for future ideas and happenings.</p>
<h6><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Legacy!</span></h6>
<p>We’ll leave something behind as a permanent marker of the United Nations in your area. So you’ll always have access to the inspiration.</p>
<p>Reciprocality, alongside unearthing and harnessing inspiration, we also have programmes that allow us to support those who have already had a light-bulb moment but are unable to fully realise their idea.</p>
<p>As a continued partner, you’ll be able to feedback to UNBOSI regarding occurrences in your locality and continue to play a part in our future plans.</p>
<p>We have a small budget, we’re keen to put this into the local communities and economies through our work and partners.</p>
<p>Most importantly of all, you’ll never have a really bad idea again, you may have silly ones but in the words of Ludwig Wittgenstein “If people never did silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>The Board of Significant Inspiration has been following leads which indicate the location of another Marble cache, dating back to the Neolithic period. Our evidence suggests that this important discovery may lay beneath the earth in East Anglia’s oldest flint mines &#8211; Grimes Graves. Where we have detected severe MUSE fluctuations.</h6>
