The more exposure to experience a marble has, the greater its capacity is to be an inspiration tool. When conducting research on historically inspired individuals, we unearthed that all of them had some form of encounter or relationship with marbles. Therefore we began to investigate marbles themselves and what correlation could exist between them and history's\u00a0greatest people. Our results revealed both complementary and conflicting explanations.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div id=\"pg-5102-1\"  class=\"panel-grid panel-no-style\" ><div id=\"pgc-5102-1-0\"  class=\"panel-grid-cell\" ><div id=\"panel-5102-1-0-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_sow-editor panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"2\" ><div\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tclass=\"so-widget-sow-editor so-widget-sow-editor-base\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t>\n<div class=\"siteorigin-widget-tinymce textwidget\">\n\t<p>Marbles date back to over 2000 BCE, having been discovered in the ancient city of Mohenjo-Daro, Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia during excavations of these areas.\u00a0A unique set of marbles was later discovered in Mohenjo-Daro\u00a0Pakistan and with strides in recent technology, we have been able to conduct an analysis of their properties. We discovered that they were able to retain concentrated inspiration which was detected as a novel substance called MUSE. Often Marbles are associated primarily with the game of Marbles, however, we have reason to believe this was not just a game but an exchange of experiences between people. Currently, the Board of Significant Inspiration is attempting to understand the methods by which Marbles absorb the experience and the transformative process by which this experience becomes an inspiration.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div><\/div><div id=\"pgc-5102-1-1\"  class=\"panel-grid-cell\" ><div id=\"panel-5102-1-1-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_sow-image panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"3\" ><div\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tclass=\"so-widget-sow-image so-widget-sow-image-default-8b5b6f678277-5102\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t>\n<div class=\"sow-image-container\">\n\t\t<img \n\tsrc=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ancient-City-of-Mohenjo-Daro.jpg\" width=\"990\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/Ancient-City-of-Mohenjo-Daro.jpg 990w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/Ancient-City-of-Mohenjo-Daro-600x382.jpg 600w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/Ancient-City-of-Mohenjo-Daro-300x191.jpg 300w, \/wp-content\/uploads\/Ancient-City-of-Mohenjo-Daro-768x489.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 990px) 100vw, 990px\" title=\"Ancient City of Mohenjo-Daro\" alt=\"\" \t\tclass=\"so-widget-image\"\/>\n\t<\/div>\n\n<h3 class=\"widget-title\">Ancient City of Mohenjo-Daro<\/h3><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/div><div id=\"pg-5102-2\"  class=\"panel-grid panel-no-style\" ><div id=\"pgc-5102-2-0\"  class=\"panel-grid-cell\" ><div id=\"panel-5102-2-0-0\" class=\"so-panel widget widget_sow-editor panel-first-child panel-last-child\" data-index=\"4\" ><div\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tclass=\"so-widget-sow-editor so-widget-sow-editor-base\"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t>\n<div class=\"siteorigin-widget-tinymce textwidget\">\n\t<h3>Many questions still remain, such as:<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>What forms of experience do Marbles absorb?<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>Do certain experiences\u00a0have a greater inspirational effect\u00a0than others?<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>How do the marbles help us understand each other's experiences?<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<li><em><strong>How can we artificially create the inspirational substance MUSE?<\/strong><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To answer these questions we must look both to Science and Philosophy in order to see the bigger picture.
